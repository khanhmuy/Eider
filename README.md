# eider_hmuy
Fun Discord bot I guess.
- [Invite link](https://hmuy.ml/eider/) (try refreshing if it doesn't work)

## Info / Disclaimer
- This is only a hobby project that I made for fun, with a lot of spaghetti code, bodges and less than ideal error handling, expect stuff to break lol.
- Discord Gateway Intents used: `Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS` (used to get server info), `Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MEMBERS` (used to get user info and logging), `Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES`, `Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_PRESENCES` (used to get user presence status in the `userinfo` command), `Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_BANS` (used for logging, moderation commands eta June 2022)

## Prerequisites:
- Anything that can run Node.js (iOS devices don't work, I tried).
- Node.js: 16.13 or newer.
- A brain and some common sense.

## How to host it yourself: 
- Step 1: Clone this repository
- Step 2: Create a Discord application, then create a bot (MAKE SURE YOUR ACCOUNT HAS 2FA ENABLED or most shit will just crash) and get the bot token (save it somewhere and **DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE**)
- Step 3: Create a file named `.env` with the content of `DISCORD_TOKEN=YOURBOTTOKEN` (replace `YOURBOTTOKEN` with the token from step 2. Optionally, you can also put your NASA OpenAPI key in for apod (Astronomy Picture of the Day). 
- Step 4: Open a terminal window, cd to the folder where the repo is saved and type `npm i`.
- Step 5: Type `npm start` or `node index.js`.
- Enjoy!
